<div id="whisky"> Real quick before I talk about the project. I can no longer see any of the images that I used for my entire website. It shouldn't affect Molly but it affects me. like why are the websites even blocked they are wallpaper websites it's not like video games it literally just computer wallpaper why is it blocked it is very annoying. Because of this I'm now just using images I have on my computer ruining my aesthetic now it's pokemon. Now onto the project, this one is just a for loop which just numbers divs this is kind of an introduction and this will be much more useful later once I know how to utalize it.
